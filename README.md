# Depth_estimation
To predict the depth images of the single RGB image using CNN

This project is about deep learning concept of retrieving the depth of an image to measure the distance between the objects and the viewer. Right now in implementation mode. Files for working on dataset has been upload. Files naming Toolbox images-checkpoint.ipynb helps in getting toolbox images of Nyuv2 depth (https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html).
Renaming multiple files.ipynb and CNN dataset split speaks for itself.
